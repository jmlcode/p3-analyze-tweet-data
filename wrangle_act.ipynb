    "## Introduction\n",
    "The process of cleaning and preparing data defines a bulk (approximately 80%) of data analysis (Dasu and Johnson 2003). In fact, data often must be cleaned and prepared multiple times throughout the course of analysis as new questions arise from a series of observations or new data is gathered to address these additional questions (Wickham 2014). To explore the vast array of possible methods for _cleaning and preparing data_ and understand the significance of this process in data analysis, this project was divided into two sections, __Data Wrangling__ and __Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization__, for analyzing Tweets from [_WeRateDogs (@dogrates)_](https://twitter.com/dog_rates).\n",
    "\n",
    "This document covers the first section, the _data wrangling_ phase of analyzing Tweets, which encompasses gathering, assessing, and cleaning data.\n",
    "* Each of the three sources of data on Tweets from _WeRateDogs (@dogrates)_ were gathered with different methods: manually downloading available data, performing a GET Request to call the URL that hosts the data, and querying Twitter API for Tweet data. \n",
    "* Then, these datasets were assessed for two types of issues, quality and tidiness.\n",
    "* The identified issues were addressed by defining a series of cleaning operations for each issue, translating the plans into codes, performing each cleaning operation, and verifying the resolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this phase, cleaned datasets were stored as separate files so that these _functional_ datasets structured in formats that permit analysis are readily available for the second phase of the data analysis, _exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization_. This second section of the project, which deals with exploring and augmenting the data to maximize the potential of the analyses and deriving insights from visualizations, is covered in a separate document.\n",

    "All relevant packages for wrangling the desired Tweet data from _WeRateDogs (@dogrates)_ are imported below."

    "[Udacity](http://udacity.com) was provided with _WeRateDogs_ Twitter Archive which contains the basic data for all 5,000+ Tweets. Udacity _enhanced_ this original dataset by extracting dog ratings, dog names, and dog _stage_ from each Tweet's text data. Note that as a part of this enhancement, the original dataset was filtered to produce 2,356 rows of data which include only the Tweets that appear to mention dog ratings. The enhanced version was made available for download and was manually imported as shown below."

    "Additional Tweet data which were omitted during the process of enhancing the Twitter archive were gathered by querying Twitter's API with Python's [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) library for each Tweet ID in the enhanced Twitter archive. This JSON-formatted data was _dumped_ to a `.txt` file. Because the counts of re-tweets and favorites were the only types of additional Tweet data the author intended to analyze and the previous datasets were imported to dataframe objects, only the re-tweet and favorite counts for each Tweet ID were extracted from the `.txt` file and were used to create a dataframe object.\n",

The two columns `in_reply_to_status_id` and `in_reply_to_user_id` appear to be outside the scope of the interest of this project. \\[see _assessments 1.1 and 1.2_ and documentation on [Tweet Object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/data-dictionary/overview/tweet-object.html)\\]\n",

    "    * These names not only begin with a lower case alphabet but are oridinary terms such as \"such\", \"a\", \"quite\", etc.\n",

    "10. Four possible dog \"stages\", doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo, are shown as column headers although these \"stages\" are not variable names. \\[see _assessment 1.1_\\]"
